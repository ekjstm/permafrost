This directory is for jars that are used by tools or tests, but not the main project.

The main project should not use any jar from this directory. If the main project adds a dependency on one of the tools libraries, that library should be moved to the main libs directory.

Cobertura depends on ASM 2.2.1. Most other tools have moved to ASM 3.x, so we need to maintain two directories seperated in the classpath.
